After installing Elmah, it opens with the following Readme.txt.

> A new HTTP handler has been configured in your application for consulting the
> error log and its feeds. It is reachable at elmah.axd under your application 
> root. If, for example, your application is deployed at http://www.example.com,
> the URL for ELMAH would be http://www.example.com/elmah.axd. You can, of
> course, change this path in your application's configuration file.
> 
> ELMAH is also set up to be secure such that it can only be accessed locally.
> You can enable remote access but then it is paramount that you secure access
> to authorized users or/and roles only. This can be done using standard
> authorization rules and configuration already built into ASP.NET. For more
> information, see http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/SecuringErrorLogPages on
> the project site.
> 
> Please review the commented out authorization section under
> `<location path="elmah.axd">` and make the appropriate changes.
